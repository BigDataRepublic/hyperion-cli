# Hyperion CLI

Command line interface for interactions with [Hyperion](https://github.com/BigDataRepublic/hyperion).

## Installation

Usage of this CLI requires Python version 3.5 or higher.

## Usage

## Developing

To see the results of your changes, run `pip install -U .` from this repository's root. Or use `pip install -e .` to install in development mode.

If you're developing this CLI against a minikube cluster, please do `export CLUSTER_NAME=minikube`. This allows some of the code to behave differently during development which comes in handy because there is no dependency on the Hyperion cluster.
